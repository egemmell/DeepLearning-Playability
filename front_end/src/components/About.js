			<h3>What is the purpose of the study?</h3>
			<p>We are conducting this study to understand how parents of 0-12 year old children view neighbourhood environments for children’s outdoor play. Additionally, we are seeking to understand how children, 5-12 years old view neighbourhood environments for play.</p>

			<h3>Why have I been invited?</h3>
			<p>This is an online study for parents of 0-12 year old children and you have been invited by way of accessing this website. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason by navigating away from the survey site. We also provide the opportunity for your 5-12 year-old child to participate and share their views.</p>

			<h3>What happens if I decide to participate?</h3>
			<p>First, the survey will ask basic questions to help us understand general information about you. You will be shown two side-by-side street-view images and asked to select an image based on the question “Which neighbourhood looks more playable for children?”  We anticipate that it will take about 5 minutes of your time to rate 10 image pairs but you may choose to rate as many image pairs as you wish. </p>

			<h3>What happens if I consent to my child’s participation?</h3>
			<p>You may consent to your 5-12 year old child’s participation after completion of the parent survey or by using the link at the bottom of this page. You will be taken to the child survey page where they can read (or be read) information about the study in child-friendly language. Your child can agree or decline to participate by clicking on thumbs up or thumbs down emoji buttons. The child survey will show image pairs with the question, “Which neighbourhood would you rather play in?” and can make their selection. Children may complete as many or as few image comparisons as they wish. </p>

			<h3>Data Privacy</h3>
			<p>No personal data that could identify you is collected as part of this study and your/your child’s responses are completely confidential. Data is hosted on a secure UBC server and stored in Canada.</p>

			<h3>Are there any disadvantages, risks or benefits to participation?</h3>
			<p>We do not anticipate any risks to you or your child as a result of participation in this study. Although you/your child may not directly benefit from participating in this study, improving understanding of how parents and children perceive neighbourhoods for outdoor play may help cities to create environments that support child health and development.</p>

			<h3>How will results of the study be used?</h3>
			<p>Results will help us to understand how children and parents view neighbourhood environments for outdoor play. Findings will be shared through publication in research journals and may also be used to develop a publicly available online tool for mapping neighbourhood playability.</p>

			<h3>Who is funding this research?</h3>
			<p>This research is funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of the Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities research collaboration.</p>

			<h3>Who can you contact if you have concerns or complaints about the study?</h3>
			<p>If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877-822-8598. <br></br>
