                        <p>We donâ€™t ask you any personal questions and your choices will be completely confidential. The survey will take from five to ten minutes. </p>
                        <p>Your parent has agreed to your participation but it is up to you to decide if you want to complete this survey. If you decide to participate, you can stop anytime by clicking away from the survey page.</p>
                        <p>Before you decide if you want to take part in this study, discuss it with your parent to make sure you understand what you need to do and that all your questions have been answered.</p>
